I'm thinking this could be a good activity for iPQB bootcamp.

After working through the worksheet with the whole class, I would split them 
into groups of 3-4 and ask each group to go through the process of publishing 
the DNA example.  Then I would ask each person to add a new feature to their 
group's published code.  This would let me briefly focus on how to share code 
on GitHub, and would hopefully give them some practice writing code in groups 
(a la PUBS) and maybe dealing with merge conflicts.

I would definitely encourage people to implement whatever features they want, 
up to and including things totally unrelated to DNA (or even science), but it 
would also be good to have a list of features that could be implemented to help 
people get started:

- Melting temperature
- Molecular weight
- Translation
- Design PCR primers
- Design Quikchange primers

Once ever person in every group had finished implementing a publishing their 
feature, I would have every group install and use some other group's project.  
Then I would have every group come up and describe the code they installed: 
what it does, how easy it was to understand, any suggestions they have for the 
authors of the code regarding the documentation.
